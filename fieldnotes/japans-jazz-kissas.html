                <p>The jazz kissaten was a gathering spot in the early to mid 1900s in Japan where bars with
                    high-fidelity sound systems would play imported jazz records that were too costly for the general
                    public to purchase themselves. I traveled to Japan primarily to meet a few friends, but ended up
                    learning about, growing intrigued by, and then, spending many of my nights inside jazz kissas.
                    Over the last calendar year I've developed a growing interest in jazz, and my time in Japan
                    unexpectedly reified this interest in a major way.</p>

                <p>In the day or two following an evening or afternoon at a jazz kissa I would jot down a few thoughts
                    or notes about my visit, sometimes as well as the day beforehand, like a travel log of sorts. I'm
                    now sat in the Kansai airport, ready to
                    board my flight back to Europe, and figured it be a good time to shape them up, a little bit, into
                    something more readable (this basically means I put my rambly notes in paragraph format without much
                    regard for anything else). I hesitated to share this, but I have titled this section of my website
                    “fieldnotes”, as in qualitative notes a researcher would scribble down during research in the field,
                    so what better for me to share here than notes scribbled down from during my 'research' (drinking
                    whisky and listening to jazz music) in the 'field' (small bars).</p>

                <p>Note that I visited "music" or "record" bars that I'm not including in here – while I enjoyed them as
                    well, for the purposes of this I'm going to talk only about older or more traditional (at least
                    traditional as I understand it to mean in this context) jazz kissas. I've written about them in
                    order that I've visited them and have also linked to their respective address on Google Maps.</p>

                <h3>jazz BIGBOY</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BEbb4emiThQKRHEM7">Map</a></p>
                <p>While wandering in and out of Jinbocho's used and rare book stores, the bright yellow door of jazz
                    BIGBOY caught my eye. It had been a mission of mine, so to speak, to find a jazz kissa simply by
                    wandering Tokyo, and on my second day in the city I had done just that. It was closed, so I wandered
                    some more and stopped in a nearby coffee shop until shortly after its opening at 13:00.</p>

                <p>Only one other man was in the shop with myself and the owner so early, sat listening to the trumpet
                    of Thad Jones from a huge speaker (which upon asking I was let know was a JBL 4343B, driven by Mark
                    Levinson preamps, if my memory serves me well). The sound was incredibly loud, given how small the
                    space was (maybe a max capacity of 10 or so people) but its quality was great.</p>

                <p>I had a drip coffee and sat near a window. A older gentleman in a blue button-down shirt with big
                    red, green, and yellow bubble letters spelling "SHIRT" stitched from the collar down one side of his
                    shirt, all the way to the hem, sat across from me shortly thereafter and alternated between writing
                    in his notebook, reading, and listening to the jazz with his eyes closed.</p>

                <p>I had a few coffees, and the music moved on from Thad Jones to the Phil Woods Trio, to Blue
                    Mitchell's 'The Cup Bearers', which I enjoyed the most of the records that were spun while I was
                    there. People came and went around me, and at a certain point, after maybe two hours, all seating
                    was fully occupied and there was a couple of younger men outside looking to sit in, so having had my
                    fill of jazz music and coffee, I decided to offer my seat and pay.</p>

                <p>I spoke briefly with the owner who asked me where I was from and recommended me a jazz kissa in Kyoto
                    – he was a very nice man, who seemed eager to speak, but who also had a lot of coffees to make, so I
                    opted to not ask him too many questions of my own.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Volontaire</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/S8z4FaxVg4G7Zj2Q8">Map</a></p>
                <p>I was in Akasaka, very close to my hotel, looking for food. One ramen place looked quite nice to me,
                    but had a long line out the door, so I figured I'd kill some time somewhere nearby. Google Maps
                    revealed to me that Volontaire, a jazz kissa, was just around the corner – and so I went. Up a set
                    of narrow stairs into a room that smelled very lightly of cigarette smoke.</p>

                <p>The room was warm in colour, with a lush red carpet and a big wooden bar, behind it shelves of
                    records surrounding a large wooden archway, contained within more shelves, but these shelves of
                    liquor, a CD player, and a turntable. The man behind the bar seemed a bit shy, likely owed to the
                    fact he didn't speak any English. I ordered a scotch and sat listening to the record spinning, the
                    name or artist of which I didn't recognize. I was the only one there aside from him, and he mostly
                    stood at the other end of the bar, going back and forth between looking at his phone and staring off
                    straight ahead. He struck me as a bit nervous, which was fine – he was very polite when serving me.
                </p>

                <p>Maybe thirty minutes into my stay a lady entered, and gesturing to her as "my sister" the man made a
                    quick exit after wishing me a good night. His sister was much more lively, and as it turned out
                    actually owned the place. I had another scotch, she served me some nuts as well, and was much very
                    eager to speak of jazz music.</p>

                <p>As it would turn out, not only was she eager to speak of jazz music, but she was seemed quite
                    knowledgeable. She seemed shocked to learn that I wasn't aware Oscar Peterson was Canadian
                    ("He's a countryman of yours!") and maybe even more shocked to know that despite Getz being a
                    favourite of mine I hadn't heard his album with Laurindo Almeida, which she promptly put on ("But
                    you must know Laurindo Almeida!"). She was very friendly, very chatty, willing to take some
                    recommendations (granted I was the only one in the bar), and I ended up sitting listening to music
                    and talking for probably almost three hours before wandering back out to get a bowl of ramen.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>DUG jazz cafe & bar</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKD7GydwfECGteJG6">Map</a></p>
                <p>With my goal of stumbling upon a jazz kissa fulfilled once by jazz BIGBOY, and then half-fulfilled
                    again with my semi-organic finding of Volontaire, I decided to look the next morning for a jazz
                    kissa that was highly recommended, or a must visit. I found DUG, which as I came to understand was a
                    jazz kissa related to DIG, founded in the late 60s by the late jazz photographer Hozumi Nakadaira.
                    DUG's popularity further grew after DIG's closing in the 80s.</p>

                <p>I took a train from Akasaka to Shinjuku around 18:00, and after a short walk from the station,
                    descended the stairs into DUG, where the air was thick and hazy, owed to the fact that not a single
                    person I saw was without a cigarette or cigar. I took a seat at the bar, one of the only seats
                    available, and ordered a Talisker (my favourite). Compared to the previous two kissas I had been in,
                    DUG seemed a lot more relaxed about the speaking (or at least the clientele seemed more comfortable
                    in doing so). I watched the bartender hand carve ice, as I sat between an old man drawing in his
                    notebook, and a younger man smoking a cigar, intermittently chatting with a bartender.</p>

                <p>The atmosphere and decor of the bar was great, although I initially wasn't much a fan of the buzzing
                    of conversation all around me, given I had come to have a drink and listen to music. Turns out
                    others conversing is a lot more palatable when you yourself are in conversation, and the man who had
                    been drawing next to me asked me where I was from in incredibly broken english. He spoke very little
                    english and we communicated through our respective translate apps. He was
                    a sculptor, and he wrote his name for me on the back of a drawing he had made (which I now have
                    taken a liking to and have been keeping with me on my travels). He kept referencing the 'master' of
                    DUG by pointing to photos around the bar of jazz musicians and speaking "master". It took me a
                    second before I clued in that he was referring to founder, Hozumi Nakadaira.</p>

                <p>I mentioned through my translate app that I had read that Nakadaira has passed away very recently,
                    and the man responded that he had been very good friends with him, then showed me relatively recent
                    photos of him and Nakadaira. I expressed my condolences for his loss, a gesture he took kindly to,
                    and we ended up sharing many drinks for his friend, all the while conversing through translate apps
                    on our phones. I won't write much on the subject of the conversation, but the nature of it was a
                    quite unique experience: being through a language barrier, through translate apps, it was a very
                    slow paced, intentional conversation, yet many messages came across as very abstract.</p>

                <p>The young girl who was serving us was eager to show us all the bottles he had drawn on, and indeed
                    there were many bottles behind the bars, the labels of which were covered in his doodles. He
                    jokingly asked a bartender to make my old fashioned cocktail garnished in a silly way, and the girl
                    serving us was very embarrassed and apologetic to hand me a drink that was garnished with half a
                    lime, half a lemon, and a quarter of an orange, the peel of which was cut into a pinwheel, held
                    together by a cocktail stick with a maraschino cherry – he thought this was quite funny. We shared
                    albums we liked by scrolling Spotify, and he asked the bar to play Stan Getz's Quartets for me.</p>

                <p>He left at around 23:00, and I left shortly after, only to find he had very generously paid for
                    practically my whole tab – everything but the two drinks I had had before him. I left, got no the
                    subway, rode one stop, before realizing I had forgotten the drawing he had made. I rushed back, and
                    the bartender had saved it, as she believed I may come back for it (very kind). I got a huge bowl of
                    ramen from a nearby shop before heading home.</p>

                <p>Possibly my most unexpectedly enjoyable night in Japan, I would love to one day return to DUG.
                    Everyone I met, staff and clientele, were friendly.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Seabird</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/veLeEbfsiKqNRyJYA">Map</a></p>
                <p>My last day in Tokyo was a Friday, and I was set to meet a friend, with whom I hadn't properly caught
                    up with since high school (although we had seen each other at gatherings once or twice since). We
                    were to get dinner in Shibuya area after he was off work, and since I had arrived in the area early
                    I decided to get a drink by myself. I wandered deep into the suburbs, where I found Seabird (with a
                    little help from Google Maps), a small jazz kissa tucked away in between what seems to be a street
                    of otherwise residential buildings. I later learned the busier road on the other side of the
                    buildings has a main entrance, which likely explains why the couple running the place was so
                    surprised to see me come down the stairs from the much smaller doorway.</p>

                <p>It being just after 17:00, I was the only one there. The couple that was running it was in the midst
                    of setting up for a live jazz night, which they very kindly invited me to stay for, but my later
                    plans meant I had to go within the hour, well before it started. I sat quietly, drinking a beer
                    listening to Sonny Rollins, while they, in similar silence set up a drum kit. It
                    felt a bit as if I was a welcome intruder on an intimate ritual, watching them set up the space for the live jazz.</p>

                <p>It's almost hard to imagine live jazz in such a setting, given that it was a very small room
                    underground, but the idea is exciting and intriguing and I do wish I could have stayed longer than I
                    did. The woman was especially friendly, asking about where I was from; the man seemed to not speak
                    much of english – in fact, when he put on a Getz CD (seems as if every jazz kissa has played Getz
                    ahaha) I recognized his playing and mentioned to the lady, who excitedly told me Getz was also her
                    husbands favourite and that he played the saxophone himself.</p>

                <p>I'd like to come back, they were very kind and, at least to my recollection, prices weren't as high
                    here as they were at other kissas I visited. </p>

                <br>

                <h3>music bar 45</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/m2Mbnn6A1ZtkeMfbA">Map</a></p>
                <p>After dinner and drinks in Shibuya with my friend, who had to turn in early as he had an event to
                    wake up for the next morning, I walked over to music bar 45. I almost missed it at first, but after
                    picking the right staircase I made my way into a dimly lit room and sat at the bar next to two Brits. The owner of the kissa was
                    friendly, and what was particularly notable is the selection of whiskey here was incredible. I
                    chatted with him about my favourite scotches and he made some recommendations. I settled on a Nikki
                    whiskey, a bottle he had very recently picked up during a visit he had made to the Yoichi distillery
                    earlier this month. With the whiskey, he served me some bittermelon he had grown in his garden,
                    marinated in a soy sauce based mixture. I had heard a lot of not-so-glowing reviews about
                    bittermelon online before, but had not actually tried it for myself, and I thought it pretty good
                    – it did have a bit of an acrid aftertaste, but I don't really mind that at all, and so the melon
                    from his garden served as a nice snack with my drink.</p>

                <p>The owner made mention he'd play more than just jazz here, and would often have DJs in to spin vinyls
                    (but not tonight, unfortunately). Nevertheless, he seemed to do quite a good job himself with his
                    turntables and set up; when I recognized a city pop song he played as a track sampled by The Weeknd
                    he laughed, "of course you'd recognize it, if you're also from Canada", and quite smoothly
                    transitioned between the original track and 'Out of time' (happy coincidence that he had Dawn FM on
                    vinyl as well).</p>

                <p>I had another drink, and spoke more to the owner, who showed me some photos of his distillery trip on
                    instagram. He was very friendly, chatting at a low volume with everyone at the bar individually,
                    never so loud as to contest with the music.</p>

                <p>The next morning I woke up to a message from him on instagram thanking me for coming and wishing me
                    safe travels – and then I boarded my train to Kanazawa, ending my time in Tokyo.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Jazz in Rokudenashi</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/16fgSqZvQSXTv38u5">Map</a></p>
                <p>After my first full day in Kyoto, I found Jazz in Rokudenashi not too far from where I was staying.
                    Walking up a tight set of stairs led to an old door with a beautiful patina. The room was narrow and
                    not too dissimilar in shape and size to music bar 45. It was similarly dark, but with tattered
                    posters on the ceiling and walls and a very slight smoke that hung in the air. The master was
                    spinning a Kenny Drew album, chatting to a younger man, who was having a cigarette, at the end of
                    the bar closest to the entrance. Two other pairs of women sat at the bar, and I opted to sit at a
                    bench with large foam puzzle pieces acting as cushions behind them, close enough behind those at the
                    bar to almost feel like I was sat a row back on a school bus.</p>

                <p>The vibe was good, the owner seemed quite nice, and the prices were very reasonable, but I sadly
                    wasn't carrying too much cash with me; this was a cash only establishment. As I had only a few
                    hundred yen pieces I opted for single of Nikka Black, which I was unfamiliar with, but decided to
                    give it a go, it being the cheapest option. True to the price, it was a lot harsher than the nicer
                    whiskies from Japan I had gotten used to, but still a more preferable drink than Jack Daniels or Jim
                    Beam, to my taste.</p>

                <p>I sat and listened to the remainder of Freddie Hubbard's trumpet work, which is what stood out the
                    most for me on Kenny Drew's Undercurrent, before paying with the last of the coins I had in my
                    shoulder bag, and stepping out into the humid Kyoto night.</p>

                <p>Edit: a few nights later, equipped with more cash, I went back. It was a lot more lively this time –
                    in fact, it was shoulder to shoulder, jam packed, so much so that some people who tried to enter had
                    to be sent away, and I shared a nice conversation with some Aussies, some Canadians, some Dutch, and
                    some Poles, as well as with a DJ who spins funk, soul, and jazz on vinyl – who I later saw doing a
                    set at a record bar nearby.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>jazz spot YAMATOYA</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HH5h9cmesfHCWrPDA">Map</a></p>
                <p>The ensuing morning I woke up with the plan of walking the philosopher's path and visiting Okazaki
                    Shrine – I was told by my friend who lives here that it was a shrine dedicated to rabbits, so it
                    seemed fitting to visit since I am, being born in 1999, a rabbit. It also just so happened to be the
                    case that YAMATOYA, a jazz kissa recommended to me by the master at BIGBOY in Tokyo was right down
                    the road from the shrine.</p>

                <p>I spent the late morning to early afternoon walking, and haven consumed nothing but a coffee before
                    walking to Ginkaku-ji, a Zen temple I wanted to see near the start of my walk down the philosopher's
                    path. By 14:00 I had worked my way to jazz spot YAMATOYA and, still on an empty stomach, entered the
                    doorway next to it's bold blue sign, and sat at the bar.</p>

                <p>The space was a bit bigger than some of the other jazz kissas I'd been to – certainly bigger than
                    Jazz in Rokudenashi – but not huge by any means; it could accommodate perhaps 15 to 20 people.
                    Despite this it felt quite cozy: red carpeted floor to match a red bar surface, flowered wallpaper à
                    la William Morris framed by blue wood trimmings, a beautiful plate that hung on the wall behind the
                    bar (which I learned was changed with the change in seasons), and a menu shaped like a top down view
                    of a piano complete with the keys. In the back corner of the bar, furthest from the door, there was
                    a model train which looked exactly like a model that sat in my Uncle's childhood bedroom in
                    Arnprior, but doubled in size.</p>

                <p>When I arrived the place was dead silent, save for the sound of a young bartender adding ice to a cup
                    of water to serve me. I was one of four people in the bar, including one client, as well as the
                    aforementioned bartender and an older gentleman, presumably the master of the kissa, who sat reading
                    behind the bar. A Stanley Turrentine album was playing, with a few more albums – a Dorris Day
                    record, some swing albums – lined up on the ground to be spun next.</p>

                <p>I let the master know when he asked me where I came from that I came from Canada, but more recently
                    came from jazz BIGBOY, who had recommended me his bar, which he seemed happy about. I then decided,
                    against my better judgement as I was on an empty stomach, to have a whisky: I had been drinking a
                    great deal of scotch and Japanese whisky, more than I should have been, over the course of my kissa
                    visits, but YAMATOYA had my favourite bourbon, Woodford Reserve, and so I ordered a single, neat.
                    About thirty minutes after I had shown up the place came to life a bit more, with almost 10 others
                    showing up over the course of a five minute period or so. Most notably, a gentleman who seemed to be
                    known to who I had (correctly) presumed to be the kissa's master, sat next to me and ordered a
                    coffee.</p>

                <p>Along with the coffee, the master served the man a thick hardcover book, that sported a pale grey cover with
                    pink lettering. It was a photo book, a collection of photos of Japan's jazz kissas, and I watch over
                    his shoulder as he flipped through it. As he did, the young bartender informed me that this was his
                    father, who had been coming here since he was a teenager. I had a bit more a conversation with the
                    bartender who seemed to be about my age and who was very kind. </p>

                <p>All the while behind us, a man equipped with a similar digital point and shoot to the one I was carrying with me was engaged in a
                    ritual of sorts, where he would, every time a new record was put on and the sleeve stood up on the
                    shelf to display it's album artwork, make his way to the shelf and capture the album artwork, flash
                    on. I had been using my fair share of Shazam at the kissas when music I liked was played, so can't
                    blame him for using the technology he knew how to use to capture and remember songs in a similar
                    way.</p>

                <p>Towards the back half of the photo book my bar-neighbour was flipping through, there a full page
                    spread of jazz YAMATOYA in all its glory, and upon seeing it he pointed to the seats the two of us
                    were sitting in and exclaimed "that's you... and that's me!", to which I responded by pointing to
                    the spot behind the bar and stating that's where his son was.</p>

                <p>I had had a few drinks at this point and, while I wasn't really feeling their effect, decided that
                    that was enough for a Friday afternoon and paid my tab after another brief conversation with the
                    bartender. I quite enjoyed my afternoon here, and would certainly come back were I to find myself in
                    Kyoto again.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>jazz HANAYA</h3>
                <p><a class="primary-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CmBWvFVsVvtEF22b7">Map</a></p>
                <p>I was planning on going to a Sukiyaki place for dinner, but the wait time seemed quite long, and
                    instead, recalling I had seen that they served food, walked over to jazz HANAYA to have a drink and
                    bite to eat. The entrance itself was quite unassuming, unless I missed any signage in the dark: just
                    a small silver placard, not much bigger than a business card, and a nondescript door set back into
                    the wall. Upon arriving I was one of two customers, the other being a Japanese man who was sat back
                    turned to the bar, looking at the massive JBL4320 speakers, which were playing Basie Jam.</p>

                <p>The kissa was run by an older gentleman and who I believe was his wife: he'd serve drinks and spin
                    records, and she'd prepare food. I was happy to see they had at their bar a recently discovered
                    favourite scotch of mine, Coal Ila 12 year old, a whisky so smoky it borders on ashy with a primary
                    tasting note of burnt and charred unripe padrón peppers. While serving me, the master asked if I was
                    from the United States; when I replied that no, I was from Canada he exclaimed "Oscar Peterson!",
                    before going back to gesturing to the cover and sleeve artwork of various LPs and talking about jazz
                    in Japanese to the other client.</p>

                <p>The lady spoke very little English but was incredibly kind and accommodating in trying to explain the
                    menu to me. I settled on cabbage stuffed with pork, in a tomato sauce, and wasn't disappointed. The
                    meat was incredibly tender, the cabbage cooked perfectly, and it came with a few slices of bread
                    with a nice crust on it (something I don't often find in Japan, as my experience has been they have
                    a penchant for delicious soft, spongy bread, but nothing as crusty as, say, a sourdough) to soak up
                    the excess tomato sauce. Very good meal, it was like eating home cooking, in the best way possible.
                </p>

                <p>The closer you looked the more cats you saw in jazz HANAYA: cat silhouettes above the kitchen
                    doorway, stuffed cats hanging off bottle of liquor, wooden cats resting atop the speakers, cat
                    magnets, bookends, you name it. I thought it was very charming. I had another scotch, this time a
                    Highland Park 12 year old, another favourite of mine, and the master made sure to point out just how
                    old the bottle was (indeed it was old and not like the branding I was familiar with).</p>

                <p>When the man down the bar from me, along with one other client who came as I started my meal left, I
                    mentioned that the sound system was very good (and it was), and the master seemed happy to hear, and
                    started sharing some technical details about his set up (some of which went over my head): he was
                    very nice and seemed happy to share and converse about his set up and jazz. The majority of what was
                    played was from the 50s and 60s, most notably some Stan Getz, Lester Young, and Grant Green.</p>

                <p>Around this time the lady brought me some slices of fruit to snack on, and excitedly told me that it
                    was Japanese pear. It was like the pears my mother would sometimes get when I was a kid (which were,
                    at least in North America, called "Asian Pears"), and was perfectly crisp, mellow and refreshing in
                    its taste.</p>

                <p>As I paid, I mentioned through my translate app to the lady that I liked all the cats, and in what
                    was possibly the most confident English I'd heard her speak all night, she exclaimed "me too!". They
                    both thanked me as I exited, and I left quite grateful that instead of getting Japanese hotpot I
                    stopped at jazz HANAYA: a really kind couple who seemed very passionate about what they were doing,
                    certainly somewhere I'd like to visit again if I ever find myself in Kyoto.</p>
