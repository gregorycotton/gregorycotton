                <p> I worked as a Product Designer with the Ontario Digital Service to help lay the groundwork for a new
                    single sign-on (SSO) for the province's digital services. We worked alongside 13 different program
                    areas and the Public Secure team before handing our work off.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Scope and context</h3>
                <p>As put by an end-user we spoke with, the current one key single sign-in portal acts as a 'fake front
                    door', in that most of the program areas using ONe-key require further verification upon the
                    completion of signing in. Some of the larger issues we tackled were:</p>

                <br>

                <p>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li>Old ONe-key accounts needed be effectively transferred to newer Public Secure accounts,</li>
                    <li>Developing sign in and sign up flows that were consistent and provided the user with a seamless
                        experience when it came to logging on with Public Secure directly through a program area for all
                        levels of authentication,</li>
                    <li>Wording and instruction, as well as around the description of the different sign-in options
                        (making sure the options of signing in with a password versus with online banking versus with a
                        Digital ID app (which is a hypothetical future-state and not a current option) was clear for
                        users).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Problem statement</h3>
                <p>We observed that ONe-key and Public Secure Pilot confuse our public users while not meeting the
                    expectations of our internal stakeholders, which causes a lower adaption of Ontario's single sign-on
                    solution from digital services, in addition to higher call centre volumes from users. Our goal was
                    to improve Ontario's single sign-on solution so that more program areas and end-users would adopt
                    Public Secure, and so that call centre volumes would subsequently be reduced.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Authentication levels</h3>
                <p>There are three unique levels of authentication: low (username and password), medium (username,
                    password and an additional piece of ID), and high (username, password, two-factor authentication).
                    Depending on the program area being accessed, different pieces of information were required within
                    and throughout these three levels of authentication to sign-up or sign-in, making the concept of a
                    single sign-on tricky (Fig. 1).</p>

                <h3>User interviews and personas</h3>
                <p>As this was an engagement occurring in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, recruiting users to
                    interview proved to be a challenge. After the synthesis of our 12 user interviews, we grouped common
                    traits and came up with three user personas (Fig. 2). As this is a single sign-on that has the
                    potential to
                    be used by effectively any member of the Ontario public, we chose not to create personas within a
                    specific niche, instead opting for a more all-encompassing set of personas to help steer our work.

                <h3>User experience design</h3>
                <p>After synthesizing stakeholder and user interviews notes we drafted up flows we found were
                    particularly common and/or problematic:</p>

                <br>

                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li>Net new user account creation,</li>
                    <li>Needs to sign in,</li>
                    <li>Forgot password,</li>
                    <li>Migrating ONe-key acount,</li>
                    <li>Single sign-on account management.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>We ultimately drafted numerous flows that encompassed everything from informing Public Secure users
                    of the portal changes to incorrect sign-on attempts, but those five flows remained the most
                    important throughout our testing sessions.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Sign-up made simpler</h3>
                <p>Shortly after we began user testing with our preliminary onboarding flows, we discovered that many
                    users confused the different sign-in options as different types of accounts altogether. Since emails
                    were mandatory regardless of the chosen sign-in method, we decided to use the email to initiate the
                    account creation proccess. On top of simplifying the flows, this changed the way many users
                    perceived the sign-in options: now instead of seeing them as different account types, they more
                    appropriately recognized as different means of signing in to the same account (Fig. 3).</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Managing additional IDs</h3>
                <p>During our testing sessions many users confused unique ID's (ie. MyBenefits' MemberID) with something
                    needed to create/sign-in to an Ontario account, while some outright forgot that it was even a part
                    of the registration process to begin with by the time the screen for it arrived. We changed it so
                    that the user is prompted to input their unique ID before creating an account (Fig. 4).</p>

                <h3>Interface</h3>
                <p>As we ran through 11 user testing sessions we ended up with five iterations of our prototypes. In the
                    ensuing section I'll detail a few more interface related changes we made to our screens.</p>

                <p>ONe-key alerts (Fig. 5): On our initial mockups we had a yellow banner, warning ONe-key users that
                    their
                    account needed to be transferred. Many non-ONe-key users we tested with were unable to determine
                    whether this warning was relevant to them or not. We changed the warning box to be less verbose in
                    future iterations, reducing the potential for confusion from those unfarmiliar with ONe-key, and
                    increasing the likeliness of a user actually reading it, in case it was pertinent to them.</p>

                <p>Improved buttons (Fig. 6): Another significant change made was the buttons on the landing page. Based
                    on
                    stakeholder feedback and then the subsequent first user tests, we were able to confirm that having
                    primary and secondary buttons inherently created a hierarchy within the options, which are all of
                    equal importance. We changed these buttons to radio buttons and soon after noticed that this users
                    were more inclined to thoroughly read through all their options.</p>

                <p>Account management (Fig. 7): With a single sign on for government services, users need the ability to
                    manage
                    profiles within a program area, as well as their overall account. For signed in users we needed a
                    dropdown menu for the user to manage account settings/sign out as well, and for navigating different
                    profiles within a service we needed a second dropdown menu.</p>

                <p>All things said and done, we mocked up 8 scenarios, with over 15 flows and more than 120 total
                    screens between them all. The five flows below are those that are relevant to the
                    aforementioned five problematic flows, and were the ones we continued to test the most.</p>
