                <p>To improve their digital delivery, the Ontario Autism Program wanted to create a secure web portal
                    for families. I worked in the discovery and alpha phases as one of two Product Designers, alongside
                    two developers and a lab leader, to create a proof of concept and to prototype some potential
                    features.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Program background</h3>
                <p>Prior to 2019 the Ontario Autism Program offered a needs-based service, where therapy was funded in
                    full. Funding was given to service providers who in turn kept waitlists. In 2019, as an attempt to
                    reduce wait times, the existing program was replaced with an interim one-time funding program where
                    a fixed amount was delivered to a family based on factors such as age, while the government worked
                    to develop a new needs-based program.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>User cohorts</h3>
                <p>Throughout the numerous stakeholder interviews we conducted, we saw different user cohorts emerge
                    based on when families and individuals registered for the OAP. We then created a series of service
                    blueprints (One example show in Fig 1.) to better understand the different in journeys, interactions with the OAP, and
                    the processes that happened backstage to support the user.</p>

            <div class="proj-txt-container">
                <p>We interviewed nine individuals, making sure to include a range of different regions in Ontario,
                    languages, degrees of access to technology, etc. Through this, this we learned more about some
                    commonly brought up pain points before workshopping with project managers and program analysts from
                    the OAP to create early personas and journey maps that were updated as we validated any assumptions.
                </p>

                <p>As was expected, many of the most brought up pain points, despite being incredibly valid stressors,
                    were about the program design itself. When it came to the pain points we could meaningfully address
                    while creating a digital product, we narrowed them down to three main issues:</p>

                <p>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li>Users were constantly unsure about the status of their funding/application,</li>
                    <li>There was uncertainty surrounding what was/n't considered an eligible expense,</li>
                    <li>Editing PDF forms requires Adobe Reader, which many users don't have access to.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The journey map(s) we created were a living breathing document that was updated as the engagement
                    progressed and we learned more about the program and applicants (Fig 2.).</p>

                <h3>User experience</h3>
                <p>Throughout the process of creating determining what features to dive deeper into we worked closely
                    with internal stakeholders to make sure we were consistently assessing the feasibility of our ideas
                    and to keep everyone in the loop. This involved holding participatory workshops where we asked
                    stakeholders to envision the flows themselves, as well as daily check-ins and biweekly
                    presentations.</p>

                <p>We had to decide on what features we would design for immediately, and what features we wanted to
                    recommend for a future state portal. The features and flows (Fig 3.) we ended up focusing on were:

            <div class="proj-txt-container">
                <h3>Interface</h3>
                <p>Once the preliminary flows had been created we set out to design an interface that allowed for
                    content to de displayed in the most easily understandable way possible. We continued to tweak our UI
                    and content throughout testing sessions with users, and ultimately had over five different
                    iterations for the interface.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Clarifying expense categories (Fig 4.): Much of our users' confusion surrounding the expense form
                    came from
                    the ambiguity of the expense category/subcategory names. We ran through a few iterations of how we
                    could most clearly display categories before deciding on very explicitly describing each category.
                </p>

                <p>Dashboard notices (Fig 5.): Through our interviews, we learned that questions related status of
                    application
                    and other milestones/important dates were abundant. Having different notices depending on where the
                    user is in the process of acquiring funding to keep them in the loop proved to be a hit during our
                    testing sessions.</p>

                <p>Breaking down pages (Fig 6.): User's did not enjoy forms that took up multiple page heights and
                    required too
                    much scrolling. We found that breaking down pages into well defined and brief sections resulted in
                    an overall more pleasant experience during user testing.</p>

                    <h3>Final mockups</h3>
                    <p>As we went through three rounds of iterative user testing we constantly made changes to our
                        mockups before they were further developed into prototypes by the developers on our team. While
                        we prototyped numerous flows, those we most rigorously tested and turned into coded prototypes
                        were:</p>

                    <p>
                    <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                        <li>Connect an existing profile to a new digital account (App. A),</li>
